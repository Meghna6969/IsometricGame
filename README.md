Hello! This game is made for the Athena Award. It was my long-dreamt game, but due to Athena's ending, I had to finish it a push a half baked game.

It was initially supposed to be a cozy isometric game where you throw haunted objects at haunted things and try to dodge them. After athena I hope to continue this idea and polishing more with more enemy types, abilities, post processing and urp shift. The game is built on Unity 3d with 3d models from assets store.
I am quite embarrassed with the quality of this work and will definitely improve after Athena, but this is my submission here.
